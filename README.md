ibuild
======

ibuild is a toolkit for AOSP setup, build, continuous integration, release and engineering computing node by bash script and other Open Source tools. It is simpleness, lightweight, decoupling, modularization, parameterization, C/S and P2P mixed architecture.

We start it from 2008 in BORQS, and refactoring again and again. It help BORQS finish 20+ products in 2009 with 150+ engineers. BORQS changed business model in 2013.
Last version was re-write in NOKIA, which will be shutdown by Microsoft.

So, I will open source it.
