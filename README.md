ibuild
======

ibuild is a toolkit for AOSP setup, build, continuous integration, release and engineering computing node by bash script.

We start it from 2008 in BORQS, and refactoring again and again. It help BORQS finish more than 20 products in 2009 with 150+ engineers.
Last version refactoring from 2014 in NOKIA, which will be shutdown by Microsoft now.
